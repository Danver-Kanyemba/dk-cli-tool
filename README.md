##Installation

    Copy the binary file to a directory in your PATH: The simplest way to install the binary file is to copy it to a directory that is included in your system's PATH environment variable. For example, you can copy the binary file to /usr/local/bin:

`sudo cp /path/to/binary/file /usr/local/bin/myapp`

Make sure to replace /path/to/binary/file with the actual path to your binary file, and myapp with the name of your application.

    Make the binary file executable: You may need to make the binary file executable using the chmod command:

`sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/myapp`

    Test the installation: Once the binary file is installed, you can test the installation by running your application from the command line:

`dk [flags]`

Replace myapp with the name of your application, and [flags] with any command-line flags that your application supports.
